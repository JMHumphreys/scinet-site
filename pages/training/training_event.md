The SCINet initiative is planning to host a number of virtual training/workshop events in the coming months for USDA ARS scientists and collaborators. Information on how to attend these events will be posted on this page closer to the event date. You might want to [take a look at training events we've hosted in the past](/training-archive), too. For information about other SCINet events, please see:
* [Upcoming events](/events/upcoming_events)
* [Past events](/events-archive/)
* [Working group pages](/working-groups) for working group-related events

|**Event** | **Date(s)** | **Time** | **Provider** | **How to Participate** |
|------|------|------|--------|--------|
|Introduction to Atlas- This 60-minute information session is for anyone interested in learning more about USDAâ€™s new state-of-the art supercomputer Atlas. This introduction will cover a range of topics including a general overview of high-performance computing, why you might want to take advantage of its capabilities in your research, and basic protocols associated with using Atlas (how to gain access to Atlas, how to log-in to your account, how to transfer data, etc.). | Nov 10, Dec 8 | See link for times | MSU VRSC | [Register now](https://reg.extension.msstate.edu/view/cal10a.aspx?ek=&ref=&aa=&sid1=&sid2=&as=81&wp=476&tz=&ms=&nav=&cc=&cat1=&cat2=&cat3=&aid=MSU&rf=&pn=) for this course. | 
|Digital Tools to Move from Precision to Decision Agriculture- Digital technologies are valuable tools that may help farmers improve efficiency and make better decisions. Remote sensing has been a key source of data from the early days of digital agriculture and has been linked to crop mapping, biophysical variables, yield forecasting, and prescriptive analytics required to monitor crop growth and agricultural output from the field scale to the global scale. The remote sensing sector has never been more capable of helping deliver on the promises of digital agriculture, thanks to recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. But there are some problems and limitations that need to be fixed before these technologies can be used effectively and agriculture is digitally transformed on a large scale. These include accuracy, interoperability, data storage, computational capacity, and farmers' reluctance to use them. The seminar will focus on two case studies: retrieval of crop biophysical parameters from UAV hyperspectral imagery and fruit detection using high-resolution UAV RGB imagery. | Nov 11 | 10-11 am CST | MSU VRSC | [Register now](https://reg.extension.msstate.edu/reg/event_page.aspx?ek=0081-0004-90dad60091e94ea383f8f38b08f9fc94) for this course. | 
|Data Carpentries: Geospatial Workshop- The SCINet Office is collaborating with The Carpentries to provide a Geospatial Workshop. This workshop will provide instruction for working with geospsatial data using R | November 29-30 | Time TBD | SCINet | Fill out this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=5zZb7e4BvE6GfuA8-g1Gl9tR3MfquElApKlGR6RyodxURVBNQ0pOTzFaSEdWN1RFSEJLQzFESUNXMy4u&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) if you are interested in taking this course. |
